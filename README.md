# codingame-api-rfc
Some API proposals to codingame team

This repository contains several API requests for the [codingame website](https://www.codingame.com).
The idea comes from [this topic](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/api-the-place-to-ask-for-improvements-in-cg-api), where [CG]G-Rom suggested that we could suggest some API structure for the future architecture of the site.

Everyone is welcome to help improve the APIs definitions or add new one. I'll be more than happy to merge your pull requests.
